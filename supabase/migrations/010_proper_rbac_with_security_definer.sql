-- =====================================================
-- PROPER RBAC WITH SECURITY DEFINER FUNCTIONS
-- =====================================================
-- This migration creates helper functions that bypass RLS
-- and rebuilds all policies to use these functions.
-- This eliminates recursion while maintaining full RBAC.
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: CREATE SECURITY DEFINER HELPER FUNCTIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Check if user has a specific role or higher in a business
-- Returns TRUE if user has the minimum required role
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_user_business_role(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_business_id UUID,
  p_minimum_role user_role
) RETURNS BOOLEAN
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_user_role user_role;
  v_role_hierarchy INTEGER;
  v_minimum_hierarchy INTEGER;
BEGIN
  -- Get user's role in the business (bypasses RLS due to SECURITY DEFINER)
  SELECT role INTO v_user_role
  FROM business_members
  WHERE user_id = p_user_id
    AND business_id = p_business_id
    AND is_active = true
  LIMIT 1;

  -- If no membership found, return false
  IF v_user_role IS NULL THEN
    RETURN FALSE;
  END IF;

  -- Define role hierarchy: member=1, admin=2, owner=3
  v_role_hierarchy := CASE v_user_role
    WHEN 'member' THEN 1
    WHEN 'admin' THEN 2
    WHEN 'owner' THEN 3
  END;

  v_minimum_hierarchy := CASE p_minimum_role
    WHEN 'member' THEN 1
    WHEN 'admin' THEN 2
    WHEN 'owner' THEN 3
  END;

  -- Check if user's role meets minimum requirement
  RETURN v_role_hierarchy >= v_minimum_hierarchy;
END;
$$;

-- Check if user is a member of a business (any role)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_business_member(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_business_id UUID
) RETURNS BOOLEAN
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Check membership (bypasses RLS due to SECURITY DEFINER)
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM business_members
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id
      AND business_id = p_business_id
      AND is_active = true
  );
END;
$$;

-- Get business owner ID (used for ownership checks)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_business_owner(
  p_business_id UUID
) RETURNS UUID
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_owner_id UUID;
BEGIN
  SELECT owner_id INTO v_owner_id
  FROM businesses
  WHERE id = p_business_id;

  RETURN v_owner_id;
END;
$$;

-- Grant execute permissions to authenticated users
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION check_user_business_role(UUID, UUID, user_role) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION is_business_member(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_business_owner(UUID) TO authenticated;
